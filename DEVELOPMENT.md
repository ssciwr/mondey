# Development

Some information on how to locally build and serve the website if you would like to make changes to the code.
There are two ways to do this:

- docker
  - closer to production environment
  - but less convenient for development - you need to rebuild the image every time you make a change
- python/pnpm
  - further from production environment setup
  - but convenient for development - see changes immediately without having to rebuild or restart anything

## Run locally with docker

Requires docker and docker compose.

1. clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ssciwr/mondey.git
cd mondey
```

2. generate a local SSL cert/key pair:

```
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -sha256 -days 365 -nodes -subj '/CN=localhost'
```

3. define settings in a .env file in the same folder as the `docker-compose.yml` file, eg:

```
SMTP_HOST=""
SECRET="abc123"
DATABASE_PASSWORD="abc123"
LOG_LEVEL="debug"
```

3. build and run the website locally in docker containers on your computer:

```sh
docker compose up --build -d
```

The website is then served at https://localhost/
(note that the SSL keys are self-signed keys and your browser will still warn about the site being insecure.)

Whenever you make a change to the code you need to re-run the above command to see the effect of your changes.

### Database

The default location for the postgres data is the `db` folder where you run the docker compose command.
To make an existing user with email address `you@address.com` into an admin, run the following commands:

Change the Docker database grep name to mondey-local-mondeydb-1 if you are running just docker DBs with local python.

```sh
docker exec -it $(docker ps | grep mondeydb-1 | awk '{print $1}') bash
psql -U postgres -d mondey
UPDATE user SET is_admin=true WHERE email='you@address.com';
```

Database migrations are done using Alembic, see [./mondey_backend/alembic/README.md](./mondey_backend/alembic/README.md) for more information.

## Run locally with Python and pnpm

Requires docker compose, Python and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation#using-a-standalone-script)

1. clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ssciwr/mondey.git
cd mondey
```

2. run the postgres mondey and user databases locally (this will start the postgres docker containers in detached mode and they will continue to run in the background):

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.localdatabases.yml up -d
```

Make sure that port `5432` && `5433` are available and check they set up to use those ports by running `docker ps -a`
They should be "Running" and show those port numbers.

3. install and run the backend development server:

```sh
cd mondey_backend
pip install -e .[tests]
cd ..
mondey-backend
```

Alternative option If you would like databases populated with fake research data and users, useful for testing the research database,
 run `mondey-backend` from the `/e2e` directory (that causes the databases to be populated with data). Proceed with step 4 in either case.
You need to carry out step 2 first either way. Step 2 sets up the database that the `mondey-backend` command will access.

4. install and run the frontend development server:

3.1: Run the frontend
```sh
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

The website is then served at http://localhost:5173/, and any changes to the frontend or backend code
will be reflected immediately in the browser.
